# My first react app

This is my first project from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/build-web-apps-with-react-firebase/">Build Web Apps with React & Firebase
</a>course

This project is an event app. You can type a name of the event to the form, choose place and date. Event will appear on the page and then you have an option to delete it.

Screens from the app:
